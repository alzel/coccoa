Computes CoCCoA scores for metabolites at a given CoCCoA degree or distance from metabolite of interest.

REQUIREMENTS
   coccoa.py requires Python module networkx to be installed

                      Isoreactions are concatenated by "|", see CoCCoA manuscript for details about dealing with isoreactions
      fluxes.minmax - bounds (reaction\tlower bound\tupper bound) on fluxes identified by flux variability analysis, for details see: http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/flux-variability-analysis

   coccoa.py       - computes CoCCoA scores for metabolites at a given CoCCoA degree or distance from metabolite of interest.
   routines.py     - contains functions required to compute CoCCoA scores
   coccoa_tests.py - unit tests for coccoa.py 

EXAMPLES
Please see original publication for details about methodology.
   1)computes scores up to 1st CoCCoA degree, see Figure 2 in the manuscript, taking into accout genes with p-values < 0.05
      python coccoa.py -folds examples/pf_gluc_vs_wt.expr -minmax examples/fluxes.minmax -r2g examples/reaction_orf_iso1.txt -degree 2 -i examples/model.bioopt -o examples/scores.1 -pval 0.05
   OUTPUT
      examples/scores.1 - contains 3 columns (degree, metabolite, score). Here score is CoCCoA score computed until maximum specified degree (-degree 2), 
                          in this case few metabolite can have maximum 1st CoCCoA degree score (e.g. UDPglucose)
   2)computes scores up to maximal possible CoCCoA degree, taking into accout all genes
      python coccoa.py -folds examples/pf_gluc_vs_wt.expr -minmax examples/fluxes.minmax -r2g examples/reaction_orf_iso1.txt -degree 100 -i examples/model.bioopt -o examples/scores.100
   OUTPUT
       examples/scores.100 - contains 3 columns (degree, metabolite, score). Here score is CoCCoA score computetd until maximum for all possible CoCCoA degrees
   3)computes scores up to 2 distance from metabolite of interest, from both sides (consumption, prodution) using alternative CoCCoA formulation, main difference is in the definition of degree, which here is just a network distance. 
    See Figure 4 and Supplementary Notes in the publication. CoCCoA degree should not be confused with network degree (node connectivity)
      python coccoa.py -folds examples/pf_gluc_vs_wt.expr -minmax examples/fluxes.minmax -r2g examples/reaction_orf_iso1.txt -degree 2 -i examples/model.bioopt -o examples/scores_alt.2 -forward
   OUTPUT
      examples/scores_alt.2.backward - contains 3 columns (degree, metabolite, score). Here score is computed using genes up 2nd + 1 metabolite neighbours away in backward direction (production side)
      examples/scores_alt.2.forward - contains 3 columns (degree, metabolite, score). Here score is computed using genes up 2nd + 1 metabolites neighbours away in forward direction (consumption side)
      e.g. To compute the final score for L-Asparagine using 2 backward and 1 forward distant gene neighbours: (-0.142430566) + 0.946909455 = 0.804478889, notice minus on consumtion site (forward). 
      This procedure should be performend only for alternative CoCCoA formulation. Notice, for higher order network distances a considerable ammont is required to compute scores.
